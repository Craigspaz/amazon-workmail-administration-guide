# About mailbox and folder permissions<a name="mail_vs_folder"></a>

Mailbox permissions apply to all folders within a mailbox\. These permissions can only be enabled by the AWS account holder or an IAM user authorized to call the Amazon WorkMail management API\. To set and change permissions for mailboxes, or for groups as a whole, use the AWS Management Console or the Amazon WorkMail API\. You can manage up to 100 mailbox and group permissions from the console\. To manage permissions for more users and groups, use the Amazon WorkMail API\.

Folder permissions apply only to a single folder\. End users can set folder permissions by using an email client, or by using the Amazon WorkMail web application\. For more information about using the Amazon WorkMail web application to share folders, see [Sharing folders and folder permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/userguide/share-folders.html) in the *Amazon WorkMail User Guide*\.
