**Note**  
Complete the [Prerequisites](prereqs.md) before getting started\.

+ [Step 2: Set up your Amazon WorkMail site](#setup-site)
+ [Step 3: Set up Amazon WorkMail user access](#setup-user)
+ [More resources](#more-getting-started)

## Step 1: Sign in to the Amazon WorkMail console<a name="workmail_signin"></a>

You must sign in to the Amazon WorkMail console before you can add users and manage accounts and mailboxes\.

**To sign in to the Amazon WorkMail console**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon WorkMail console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/workmail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/)\.

1. If necessary, go to the navigation bar and select the AWS Region that meets your needs\. For more information, see [Regions and endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

## Step 2: Set up your Amazon WorkMail site<a name="setup-site"></a>

1. After you sign in to the Amazon WorkMail console, set up your organization and add a domain\. We recommend using a dedicated domain for your Amazon WorkMail organization\. For more information, see [Creating an organization](add_new_organization.md) and [Adding a domain](add_domain.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) You can choose to use a free testing domain provided by Amazon WorkMail\. If you choose to do this, skip to step 4\.
**Note**  
Test domains use this format: *example***\.awsapps\.com**\. As you go, remember that you only use test domains for testing, never for production\. Also, you must have at least one enabled user in your WorkMail organization\. If you don't have an enabled user, the domain can become available for registration and use by other customers\.

1. If you are using an external domain, verify your domain by adding the appropriate TXT and MX records to your DNS service\. Make sure to set your domain as the default for your organization\. For more information, see [Verifying domains](domain_verification.md) and [Choosing the default domain](default_domain.md)\.

1. Create new users or enable your existing directory users for Amazon WorkMail\. For more information, see [Managing user accounts](manage-users.md)\.

1. \(Optional\) If you have existing Microsoft Exchange mailboxes, migrate them to Amazon WorkMail\. For more information, see [Migrating to Amazon WorkMail](migration_overview.md)\.

After you've finished setting up your Amazon WorkMail site, you can access Amazon WorkMail using the web application URL\.

**To locate your Amazon WorkMail web application URL**

1. Open the Amazon WorkMail console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/workmail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/)\.

1. For **Organizations**, choose the name of your organization\.

1. In the navigation panel, choose **Organization settings**\.

The web application URL is on the **General settings** tab and looks like this: https://*alias*\.awsapps\.com/mail\.

## Step 3: Set up Amazon WorkMail user access<a name="setup-user"></a>

Choose from the following options to set up Amazon WorkMail user access:
+ Set up user access from an existing desktop client using the Microsoft Outlook client\. For more information, see [Connect Microsoft Outlook to your Amazon WorkMail account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/userguide/connect_mail_client.html)\.
+ Set up user access from a mobile device, such as a Kindle, Android, iPad, or iPhone\. For more information, see [Getting started with a mobile device](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/userguide/mobile-start.html)\.
+ Set up user access with any IMAP\-compatible client software\. For more information, see [Connect IMAP clients to Your Amazon WorkMail account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/userguide/using_IMAP_client.html)\.
