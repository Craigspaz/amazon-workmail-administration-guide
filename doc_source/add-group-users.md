# Adding users as members to a group<a name="add-group-users"></a>

After you create and enable an Amazon WorkMail group, use the Amazon WorkMail console to add members to that group\.

**Note**  
If Amazon WorkMail is integrated with a connected Active Directory service or Microsoft Active Directory, you can use Active Directory to manage your group members\. However, changes can take longer to propagate to Amazon WorkMail\.

The following steps explain how to add up to 100 users at a time\.

**To add users to a group**

1. Open the Amazon WorkMail console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/workmail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/)\.

   If necessary, change the AWS Region\. In the bar at the top of the console window, open the **Select a Region** list and choose a Region\. For more information, see [Regions and endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Organizations**, then choose the name of your organization\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Groups**\.

1. Select the name of the group\.

1. On the **Group details** page, choose **Members**\.

1. Choose **Edit**\.

1. Under **Users and groups**, search for the users to add to the group, and select them\.

Your changes can take a few minutes to propagate\.
