# Working with groups<a name="groups_overview"></a>

You can use groups as distribution lists in Amazon WorkMail for receiving emails for generic email addresses, such as sales@example\.com or support@example\.com\. You can create multiple email aliases for a group\.

You can also use groups as security groups to share a mailbox or calendar with a certain team\. 

Groups don't have their own mailboxes, and that affects the mailbox permissions that you can grant to a group\. For information about setting up mailbox permissions for a group, see [Managing mailbox permissions for groups](manage_group_perms.md)\.

**Note**  
It can take up to 2 hours before newly added groups appear in your Microsoft Outlook offline address book\.
