# Removing users from a group<a name="remove-group-users"></a>

Use the Amazon WorkMail console to remove users from a group\.

**Note**  
If Amazon WorkMail is integrated with a connected Active Directory or Microsoft Active Directory, you can use Active Directory to manage your group members\. However, doing so can create the time needed to propagate your changes to Amazon WorkMail\.

**To remove users from a group**

1. Open the Amazon WorkMail console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/workmail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/)\.

   If necessary, change the AWS Region\. In the bar at the top of the console window, open the **Select a Region** list and choose a Region\. For more information, see [Regions and endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Organizations**, then choose the name of your organization\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Groups**, then choose the name of the group\.

1. On the **Group details** page, choose **Members**\.

1. Choose **Edit**\.

1. Under **Group members**, search for the users to add to the group, and select them\.

1. Choose **<<**\. The users no longer appear under **Group members**\.

1. Choose **Save**\.

Your changes can take a few minutes to propagate\.
