# Creating an organization<a name="add_new_organization"></a>

To use Amazon WorkMail, you must first create an organization\. One AWS account can have multiple Amazon WorkMail organizations\. When you create an organization, you also select a domain for the organization and set up user directory and encryption settings\.

You can either create a new user directory, or integrate Amazon WorkMail with an existing directory such as an on\-premises Microsoft Active Directory, AWS Managed Active Directory, or Simple AD\. By integrating with your on\-premises directory, you can use your existing users and groups in Amazon WorkMail, and users can sign in with their existing credentials\. If you’re using an existing directory that is on\-premises, you must first set up an AD Connector in AWS Directory Service\. The AD Connector synchronizes your users and groups to the Amazon WorkMail address book and performs user authentication requests\. For more information, see [Active Directory Connector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/directory_ad_connector.html) in the *AWS Directory Service Administration Guide*\.

You also have the option to select a customer managed master key that Amazon WorkMail uses to encrypt the mailbox content\. You can either select the default AWS managed master key for Amazon WorkMail, or select an existing customer managed master key in AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\)\. For information about creating a new customer managed master key, see [Creating keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\. If you are signed in as an AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) user, make yourself a key administrator on the master key\. For more information, see [Enabling and disabling keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/enabling-keys.html) in the *AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide*\.

**Considerations**  
Remember the following when creating an Amazon WorkMail organization:
+ Amazon WorkMail does not currently support managed Microsoft Active Directory services that are shared with multiple accounts\.
+ If you have an on\-premises Active Directory with Microsoft Exchange and an AD Connector, we recommend configuring interoperability settings for your organization\. This allows you to minimize disruption to your users as you migrate mailboxes to Amazon WorkMail, or use Amazon WorkMail for a subset of your corporate mailboxes\. For more information, see [Interoperability between Amazon WorkMail and Microsoft Exchange](interoperability.md)\. 
+ If you select the **Free test domain** option, you can start using your Amazon WorkMail organization with the provided test domain\. The test domain format is *example*\.awsapps\.com\. You can use the test mail domain with Amazon WorkMail and other supported AWS services as long as you maintain enabled users in your Amazon WorkMail organization\. However, you cannot use the test domain for other purposes\. Also, the test domain might become available for registration and use by other customers if your Amazon WorkMail organization does not maintain at least one enabled user\.
+ Amazon WorkMail does not support multi\-region directories\.

## Creating a new organization<a name="create-organization"></a>

Create a new organization in the Amazon WorkMail console\.

**To create an organization**

1. Open the Amazon WorkMail console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/workmail/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/workmail/)\.

1. In the navigation bar, select the AWS Region that meets your needs\. For more information, see [Regions and Endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.

1. For **Get started**, choose **Create organization**\.

1. For **Email domain**, select the domain to use for the email addresses in your organization\. Choose from the following options:
   + ****Existing Route 53 domain**** – Select an existing domain that you manage with an Amazon Route 53 \(Route 53\) hosted zone\.
   + ****New Route 53 domain**** – Register a new Route 53 domain name to use with Amazon WorkMail\. 
   + ****External domain**** – Enter an existing domain that you manage with an external DNS provider\.
   + ****Free test domain**** – Use a free test domain provided by Amazon WorkMail, and add a domain later\.

1. \(Optional\) For **Route 53 hosted zone**, select your Route 53 domain if you are using one\.

1. For **Alias**, enter a unique alias for your organization\.

1. Under **Advanced settings**, for **User directory**, select one of the following options:
   + **Create new Amazon WorkMail directory** – Creates a new directory for you to add your users\.
   + **Use existing directory** – Uses an existing directory to manage your users, such as an on\-premises Microsoft Active Directory, AWS Managed Active Directory, or Simple AD\.

1. For **Encryption**, select one of the following options:
   + **Use an Amazon WorkMail managed key** – Creates a new encryption key in your account\.
   + **Use existing customer managed key \(CMK\)** – Uses an existing CMK that you have already created in AWS KMS\.

1. Choose **Create organization**\.

If you are using an external domain, you'll want to verify it by adding the appropriate TXT and MX records to your DNS service\. Make sure to set your domain as the default for your organization\. For more information, see [Verifying domains](domain_verification.md) and [Choosing the default domain](default_domain.md)\.

When your organization is **Active**, you can add users to it and set up their email clients\. For more information, see [Managing user accounts](manage-users.md) and [Setting up email clients for Amazon WorkMail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workmail/latest/userguide/clients.html)\.

## Integrating an Amazon WorkDocs or Workspaces directory<a name="compatible"></a>

To use Amazon WorkMail with Amazon WorkDocs or Workspaces, create a compatible directory by using the following steps\.

**To add a compatible Amazon WorkDocs or Workspaces directory**

1. Create a compatible directory using Amazon WorkDocs or Workspaces\.

   1. For Amazon WorkDocs instructions, see [Getting started with Quick Start](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workdocs/latest/adminguide/cloud_quick_start.html) in the *Amazon WorkDocs Administration Guide*\.

   1. For Workspaces instructions, see [Get started with Amazon Workspaces Quick Setup](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/workspaces/latest/adminguide/getting-started.html) in the *Amazon Workspaces Administration Guide*\.

1. In the Amazon WorkMail console, create your Amazon WorkMail organization and choose to use your existing directory for it\. For more information, see [Creating a new organization](#create-organization)\.
